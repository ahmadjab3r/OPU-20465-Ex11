Hello,
This is a test for "Exercise 11 in OOP", testing the functionality of
the exercise. the letter in the start of each line is supposed to be
a capital letter, AND and letter afterwards that is also CAPITAL, is
supposed to become small LETTER.



The program disregards all numbers, the submission date for the
exercise is 01/12/2024, and... if you need any help contact me at
gimme100@lol.com

Have a good day ^^
